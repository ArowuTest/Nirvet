# Module Definition of Done (DoD)

**Rule:** a module is not "done" until it can answer YES (or a justified N/A) to every question below.
Run this checklist before marking any module complete — retroactively and for new work. Honesty over green ticks:
a documented gap is fine; a hidden one is not.

## The 10 questions

1. **Unit tests** — pure logic covered, runs anywhere (no external deps)?
2. **Integration tests** — exercised against a real DB/dependency (gated on `NIRVET_TEST_DATABASE_URL`)?
3. **Audit logs** — mutations recorded to the immutable audit trail (NFR-003)?
4. **Multi-tenant aware** — every row/query/action tenant-scoped via RLS (ADR-0001)?
5. **RBAC** — endpoints gated by role (`RequireRole`)?
6. **Error handling** — typed `httpx.APIError`, no leaked internals, fail-closed on security?
7. **Documented** — package doc + this DoD; endpoints in the OpenAPI spec?
8. **OpenAPI/Swagger** — endpoints in `backend/api/openapi.yaml`, served at `/openapi.yaml` + `/docs`?
9. **Observable** — metrics + structured logging (+ request/trace IDs), tracing spans?
10. **Horizontal scale** — stateless handler; shared state in DB/Redis; worker uses `SKIP LOCKED`?

¹ ingestion audit = raw_events evidence trail (excluded from the mutation-audit middleware by design).
² rate limiting now has BOTH backends behind the `Allower` interface: in-memory (default) + a Redis token-bucket
  limiter (global across replicas, `NIRVET_REDIS_ADDR`) — horizontal scale ✅. Redis limiter verified against a
  real instance (burst/refill + two-instances-share-one-bucket).
³ incident is covered by the `Heartbeat_EndToEnd` integration test (promote → assign → note → playbook → close)
  and the `IncidentPromotion` test; assign/close/timeline links are all asserted. See `build/HEARTBEAT.md`.
⁴ ai unit tests cover the assistive-only guardrails: offline fallback restates OBSERVED evidence, never implies
  self-execution, routes response through the approval workflow; gateway availability; system-prompt guardrails.
⁵ billing integration test asserts ingest-quota enforcement (meter vs cap) and the non-positive-cap clamp.
⁶ alert has no standalone unit test (CreateFromEvent is DB-bound); its behaviour — idempotent dedupe, field
  mapping, promotion linkage — is covered by AlertDedupe, IncidentPromotion, Heartbeat and Reporting integration.
⁷ reporting aggregates covered by ReportingSummaryAggregates (severity/stage/open counts under RLS).
  tenant now has a unit test (name validation) + integration coverage (harness creates tenants w/ defaults).
⁸ sso covered by mock-IdP integration tests. OIDC (TestSSO_OIDCFlow): JIT provision + session + re-login,
  plus fail-closed nonce/audience/domain/forged-state. SAML (TestSAML_Flow) against a goxmldsig-SIGNED mock IdP:
  happy path + 7 fail-closed controls — tampered assertion, untrusted IdP cert, expired, wrong audience, wrong
  issuer, InResponseTo replay/CSRF, forged RelayState. XML dsig is NOT hand-rolled (gosaml2/goxmldsig); flagged
  for pre-go-live expert security review. OIDC + SAML share one tested login tail (completeSSO).
⁹ ticketing covered by mock-endpoint tests (ServiceNow + Jira create, basic auth, project-key guard) + the
  MirrorIncident DB path (no-op when unconfigured) + an integration test asserting the incident timeline records
  the external ticket ref on open.
¹⁰ eventstore has two backends behind one interface (ADR-0002): Postgres (default) + ClickHouse. Verified against
  a real ClickHouse: append idempotency, tenant isolation on query, severity filter — AND the full heartbeat runs
  end-to-end on ClickHouse (interface swap proven). Gated on NIRVET_CLICKHOUSE_DSN.
¹¹ ai integration = AICopilotIncidentTriage (grounded triage over incident+alerts+asset criticality+SLA; assistive
  wording; audited output via auditMeta) in the flow suite.
¹² notify integration = the durable outbox (SLABreachSweepAlertsOnce asserts enqueue→deliver pending→sent;
  SLANotifyOutboxRetryAndDeadLetter asserts retry→dead-letter, never dropped). Transport is still the log channel —
  real email/Teams/Slack channels remain the open slice (see caveats).

## Cross-cutting notes

- **#3 Audit** — an audit middleware records **every** successful authenticated mutation, so audit is YES for all
  mutating modules automatically. Read-only modules (reporting/compliance) are n/a.
- **#9 Observability** — metrics (Prometheus) + structured logging + request IDs are platform-wide; **tracing**
  (OpenTelemetry) is implemented in `internal/platform/tracing` (W3C TraceContext propagation, route-templated
  server spans, OTLP/HTTP exporter gated on `NIRVET_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, no-op + zero overhead by default; access
  logs carry `trace_id`). Unit-tested (no-op default, span naming, error status). Portable per ADR-0005 —
  endpoint swaps local → GCP Cloud Trace with no code change.
- **#10 Scale** — API and worker are stateless containers; the ingest worker is safe to run N-wide
  (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`). Only rate-limit counters are per-instance (Redis for global limits — ADR-0005).

## Security posture

A security review (Jul 2026) found and fixed 5 Criticals + several High/Med issues
(audit immutability, SSO role escalation, ingest severity ordering, ingestion
durability, production vault guard, SOAR four-eyes, worker panic recovery, self-service
password change, login brute-force lockout). Full findings, fix commits, and the items
**deferred to pre-go-live** are tracked in [`SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](SECURITY_REVIEW.md).
That file is authoritative for security status.

## Test-coverage gaps closed (this pass)

- **#8 OpenAPI** — DONE: `backend/api/openapi.yaml` embedded + served at `/openapi.yaml` + `/docs`.
- **#9 Tracing** — DONE: OpenTelemetry in `internal/platform/tracing` (+ unit tests), wired into api & worker.
- **#1/#2 tests** — DONE: ai (guardrails), threatintel (enricher), billing (quota), reporting (aggregates),
  tenant (validation), incident (heartbeat). alert is integration-covered (no standalone unit — DB-bound).

## Honest scope caveats (matrix ✅ = "built + tested", NOT "feature-complete")

The matrix rates engineering DoD, not product completeness. Several modules are
intentionally shallow and must not be read as full features (see SECURITY_REVIEW.md
"Known functional gaps"): **threatintel** is watchlist-only (no STIX/TAXII),
**notify** now delivers durably via the outbox but only to the **log channel** (no
real email/Teams/Slack transport yet), **compliance** is static, **reporting** is JSON
aggregates only. Not yet built: **customer-facing portal**, fine-grained **read-side
RBAC** for customer viewers, the **MFA login UI** (API + enforcement exist; front-end
prompt pending designer HTML), and a **syslog listener** (webhook + Defender pull exist).
Incident **SLA timers** AND proactive **breach alerting** are now implemented
(per-severity ack/resolve targets + derived breach flags + durable-outbox notification).
